# Smart Four Website
This is the client side of my smart four multiplayer website which is hosted on GitHub Pages at https://jpolisky.github.io/smart-four/
The backend information is stored in the smartfour-server repo and hosted for free on Render which is why it often takes a minute or two to load at first.

The game itself is based on the real-life game where the goal is to place four cubes of your color in a row in any direction (including every diagonal).
To play with a friend, one of you should create a room and the other should join it with the room code in the bottom left corner.
Anybody else who wants to watch can spectate by simply joining the room after the other players are already in.
